## Reach-scale channel classification
Geomorphic classification remains the most efficient method for management of entire river networks with the understanding that changing morphology can drive ecological differences in those streams. This research focuses on classification of rivers throughout the state of California for the purpose of informing environmental flow strategies. We use multivariate statistical techniques to classify reach-scale channel surveys. These channel types are necessary to understand potential ecological impacts of flow alteration across entire basins within California.

## Geomorphic variability of streams
Although dimensionality (i.e. width and depth) of streams throughout the world generally adhere to at-a-station and downstream hydraulic geometry relationships, those relationships exhibit order-of-magnitude variability. Various physical mechanisms are responsible for variability in channel form. One of those mechanisms is flow convergence routing. While flow convergence routing landforms have been identified along single reaches, this research focuses on the frequency of those landforms across the state of California. In addition, we are assessing whether or not those forms represent observable processes shown in empirical studies.
