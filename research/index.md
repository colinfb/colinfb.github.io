# Research

## Reach-scale channel classification
This research focuses on classification of rivers throughout the state of California for the purpose of informing environmental flow strategies. We use multivariate statistical techniques to classify reach-scale channel surveys. These channel types are necessary to understand potential ecological impacts of flow alteration across entire basins within California.
