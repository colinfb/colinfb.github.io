## Current position

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Davis. Under the advisement of Gregory Pasternack, I study geomorphic classification of rivers to help inform California's environmental flow initiative. My theoretical research focuses on factors that may or may not influence the spatial distribution of channel types. In addition, I'm also investigating how statistical differences in channel forms are distributed across the state and if those patterns are representative of underlying physical mechanisms of fluvial self-maintenance.

## Previous education

I earned my PhD at the University of New Mexico. There I studied the physical mechanisms of flood wave attenuation along the Rio Grande with a focus on how the spatiotemporal dynamics of lateral surface connectivity between the main channel and floodplain impacts that process. Prior to my time in New Mexico, I studied Zoology (B.S.) and Biological Systems Engineering (M.S.) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
